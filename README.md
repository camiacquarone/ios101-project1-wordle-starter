# Project 1 - *Wordle Pt.1 *

Submitted by: **Camila Acquarone**

**The Wordle Game** is an app that encourages its users to think creativly and solve a puzzle of five letters. After a guess, if the letter is in the correct place, it will be green, if the letter is in the word but in the incorrect place then it will be yellow, if the letter is not in the word it will be gray. The player has 6 guesses.

## Notes

I had an issue towards the end of the project. I created a design on Canva and dowlowaded to be able to add a launching screen and a picture for the app when you see it on the home screen. However, the dimensions had to be very specific. If it tried compressing it, it messed up the design. Finally I was able to download the image with the correct dimensions and include it in the app.
